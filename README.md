# Machine Learning Tasks - Credit Card Fraud Detection, Customer Churn Prediction, Spam SMS Detection

## About the Project

This machine learning project is part of the Codsoft internship, focusing on three distinct tasks: Credit Card Fraud Detection, Customer Churn Prediction, and Spam SMS Detection. Each task involves exploring and experimenting with various machine learning algorithms using Jupyter Notebooks.

### Codsoft's Approach to Machine Learning

At Codsoft, we embrace the transformative power of machine learning—a field that lies at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms enable systems to automatically learn and improve from experience, making them a powerful tool for solving complex problems and making data-driven decisions.

### Understanding Data

Machine learning begins with data. In our projects, we leverage datasets relevant to each task—Credit Card Fraud Detection, Customer Churn Prediction, and Spam SMS Detection. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step where we analyze and visualize data to gain insights into patterns and trends.

### Building Models

The heart of machine learning lies in building models that can make predictions or classifications. We experiment with various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and others. These models are trained on historical data, allowing them to generalize and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

### Jupyter Notebooks for Transparency

Our projects utilize Jupyter Notebooks, interactive documents that combine code, visualizations, and narrative text. These notebooks provide transparency into our analysis, making it easy for community members to understand and contribute to the ongoing machine learning endeavors.


### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

#### Jupyter Notebook:                       

The Credit Card Fraud Detection task aims to build a model that can identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project utilizes a dataset containing information about credit card transactions. Through data exploration, preprocessing, and the implementation of algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, the goal is to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

#### Jupyter Notebook: 

The Customer Churn Prediction task involves developing a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Utilizing historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, the project covers exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to predict and understand factors contributing to customer churn.

### Task 4: Spam SMS Detection

#### Jupyter Notebook: 
The Spam SMS Detection task focuses on building an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings, combined with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, are employed. The project aims to create an effective spam filter for SMS messages, contributing to the identification and prevention of unwanted communication.
